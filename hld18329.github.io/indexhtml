    <center><h1>Music: The Simplicity and Complexity</h1></center>
    <center><h3>Intro</h3></center>
    <center><p>Music is something that is extremely versatile, yet can be as simple as playing one note. It is something that is very complex and most people don't take the time to really appreciate all that it can be. There are is an endless amount to the types of music that you can have, and even though these types can contain so much diversity they still have to power to bring people together. I once was told that "music is one of the very few things that links everything together. Not just the people in this room, but people across the planet." I know that all of this may sound cheesy, but hopefully an appreciation of music can be gained by someone by this project.</p></center>
    <center><h3>Simple Notes</h3></center>
    <center><p> <b>The definition of music is vocal or instrumental sounds that produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.</b> There are just seven notes in music that are used to make up so many different songs. These notes are A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Each note a step higher in pitch than the last. There are however, many different keys that these notes can be played in which will either mean that these notes could be much higher or much lower than a normal scale. They can also sound happy or sad based on which key these notes are played in; a major key which is happy sounding or a minor key, which is sad sounding. You can also make a note something called "sharp" or "flat" which is when you either make the note slightly higher than its original pitch if it is sharp. Or you make the note slightly lower than the original pitch if it is flat and these two things give an even bigger range to the amount of things that music can do. For example, if you took an A note and made it sharp it would be an A#.</p></center>

    <h3>Complex Notes</h3>
    <p>Reading music is quite complex sometimes, especially when it involves a lot of sharps or flats or the instrument you are using because music looks much different for each instrument. Each different instrument you use to play these notes plays a huge role in how these notes will sound. For example, notes played on a guitar would obviously give a much different sound than playing notes on a piano would. The first thing you need to know about reading music is what the music notes actually go on; this is called a staff. This is made up of five lines and then on this staff the first thing you add would be a clef. This can either be a base clef, which is used for lower sounding notes most of the time or a treble clef which is used for higher sounding notes. after this you would add a time signiture to the staff; this lets you know how many beats each note will get and which note gets the whole beat.</p>

    <h3>Reading Music Basics</h3>
    <p>There are many different types of notes that you can choose from to put on this staff. The main notes that there are to choose from are</p>
    <h2>Beats per Note</h2> <img src="images/musicnotes.jpg" alt="music notes" width="500" height="300" align="center" />
    <ul> 
        <li>whole note = 4 beats</li>
        <li>half note = 2 beats</li>
        <li>quarter note = 1 beat</li>
        <li>eigth note = half of a beat</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are other notes to choose from as well, but these notes seldom get used. At the same time of choosing how long you want each beat to get held for you would choose what pitch you want each note to be at. Each note gets placed on a different part of the staff depending on what key you're in. These notes can be placed on a line or in the space between two lines. The fifth line or bottom line of the staff is where the lower notes are placed and the first line or top line is where the higher notes get placed; the notes will get higher as you look at a staff from bottom to top. You read music this way for both piano and voice. Some guitarists may also choose to read this way.</p>
    <h3>Different Ways to Read Music</h3>
    <p>There is another way to read guitar music, which I think most guitar players prefer; I myself learned guitar using this method. <i>Guitar tabs</i> and <i>chord charts<i> are a method of learning guitar that I find easier than trying to learn by reading sheet music. Even though these forms are different from reading music from a staff there are still similarities between the two. When I was learning guitar, my teacher told me to view the neck of the guitar as a music staff because when you play a guitar the strings start out at a low pitch and with each of the strings, continue to get higher in pitch much like the way you put music on a staff.</p>
